      <p>We got our start back in 2012 designing nerdy t-shirts, but our lives changed forever when we launched our first Kickstarter project, Unstable Unicorns, in 2017. For the past five years, we've been designing tabletop games with the goal of bringing people together through interactive gameplay, engaging characters, and immersive worlds. With each project, we've learned from your feedback while pushing ourselves to create something new and exciting that we ourselves want to play over and over.

        We're still astounded by the response we've received on our games thus far, but we'll never forget that first project. We had no idea what we were doing, and the Kickstarter community embraced us and held our hands throughout the process to ensure we succeeded despite our novice mistakes. As we stand before you now with our newest creation, we want to thank you for opening this path for us and making it possible for us to do what we love every single day.</p>

      <p>Creating a new game with an immersive world is always an interesting challenge. Our team has often had the philosophical debate of whether we should start with mechanics or start with theme, or start with loose theme then build mechanics then refine the theme, or start with loose mechanics then loose theme then tighten mechanics then refine theme….you get the point.

      But with Casting Shadows, we took a particularly circuitous path, allowing ourselves to stay in an exploratory phase for much longer than we have with any other game. Each time we had a new idea for a mechanic, we reconsidered our theme choices, and each time we had an idea to enhance the theme, we went back and revised the mechanics again.

        The result was a marriage between the two where theme and mechanics influenced each other in a feedback loop that ran over and over until they merged seamlessly. But it also meant we created a lot of artwork along the way that never made it into the game, and we wanted to share some of that progression that led to the game you see today.
        For most of the first year that we worked on this game, we were pretty heavily invested in a post-apocalyptic theme with characters that mutated through exposure to radioactivity.</p>

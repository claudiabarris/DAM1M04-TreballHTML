    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <P>In Casting Shadows, players take turns traveling to different locations to collect Resources and learn Spells. Build your power, transform into your Shadow Form, and vanquish all of your opponents to win the game!</P>
    <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
    <p> Each player gets to choose a character to represent them throughout the game. Each character comes with a double-sided Player Board featuring your base form on one side and your Shadow Form on the other. Wheels on the two sides of your Player Board will allow you to track your HP and Shadow Energy you absorb throughout the game. Plus, once you transform, you gain access to your character's unique 
      ability that can grant you a huge advantage in the game! 
        We designed the double-sided Player Boards so that your HP 
        and Shadow Energy will be set at the right levels on the other 
        side when you flip them over into Shadow Form</p>

        Hex tiles represent different locations within the game, and each location grants you an advantage (ranging from extra resource allocations to healing to damage coverage). You'll also be able to learn useful spells (or counterspells) at each location that you can use to gain the edge over your opponents.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>RESOURCES AND COMPANIOS</h1>
    <P>At the start of each turn, you'll roll the 5 Resource dice to determine which Resources you have at your disposal. These Resources, which include Gems, Orbs, Shadow Fragments, and Cursed Crystals, can be used to learn new Spells and to use those Spells to attack your opponents. Because your Resources are limited, you'll have to plan carefully to make the most of them during your turn.

    Since the Resource requirements in the game rely on colors, we also placed small dots to the right or left of certain Resources to make them colorblind-friendly.</P>
    <P>When you transform into Shadow Form, you may immediately choose and summon a Companion that will stay by your side for the remainder of the game. Each Companion has a unique effect that remains continuously active. You only get one Companion, so choose wisely!</P>

      <p>
       Spell cards come in two forms: Conversion Spells and Attack Spells. Conversion Spells allow you to turn your Resources into different Resources or add Resources to your Resource Pool. Attack Spells allow you to deal damage to other players within range. Some allow you to deal damage to only one player at a time, while others allow you to deal damage to all players on the same Hex tile. You can also upgrade your Spell cards to learn even more powerful attacks!
